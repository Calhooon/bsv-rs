## [Unreleased]

### Added — midstate-reuse sighash API (`SighashCache`)

- **`primitives::bsv::sighash::SighashCache`** — a cache over one
  transaction's BIP-143 midstates (`hashPrevouts`, `hashSequence`,
  `hashOutputs`), following rust-bitcoin's `SighashCache` pattern. Each
  midstate is computed lazily at most once per scope class and reused across
  inputs; the free functions recompute all three per call, making per-input
  signing of an n-input transaction O(n²) in hashing (a measured ~9× penalty
  at n=50). One cache instance safely serves mixed sighash scopes
  (ALL/NONE/SINGLE × ANYONECANPAY × FORKID). API:
  `SighashCache::new(&RawTransaction)` / `from_parts(...)`,
  `hash_prevouts(scope)`, `hash_sequence(scope)`,
  `hash_outputs(input_index, scope)`,
  `preimage(input_index, subscript, satoshis, scope)`,
  `sighash(...)` (display order), `sighash_for_signing(...)` (signing order).
- `build_sighash_preimage` (and therefore `compute_sighash` /
  `compute_sighash_for_signing`) is now a thin wrapper over a fresh
  single-use `SighashCache` — one preimage implementation in the crate,
  public API and behavior unchanged. Byte-equality is pinned by scope-class
  unit tests, by the 499-vector cross-SDK sighash suite run through the cache
  across every input, and by the 5,116-vector ts-stack conformance census
  (`tests/conformance_scripts.rs`), whose sighash path now exercises the
  cache directly.

### Documented

- RFC 6979 digest-domain note on `PrivateKey::sign` and in the `sighash`
  module docs: for a digest >= n (P ≈ 2⁻¹²⁸ for sha256d output), k256 seeds
  the nonce DRBG with `bits2octets(digest)` per the RFC while libsecp256k1
  and `@bsv/sdk` seed it with the raw digest bytes — deterministic signature
  bytes differ across stacks in that regime only; in-range digests are signed
  byte-identically. Pinned by `rfc6979_in_range_digest_der_is_pinned` and
  `rfc6979_digest_ge_n_der_is_pinned` in `tests/ec_tests.rs`.

## [0.3.16] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed — Spend engine ts-sdk parity

Four `Spend` divergences from the TypeScript `@bsv/sdk` engine, surfaced by
executing large OP_PUSH_TX-style covenant scripts that are valid under ts-sdk
and accepted by mainnet nodes but failed bsv-rs local validation:

- **Version-based relaxed mode.** ts-sdk runs transactions with version > 1
  under post-Genesis "relaxed" semantics (`Spend.isRelaxed()`): MINIMALDATA,
  LOW_S and CLEANSTACK are not enforced. bsv-rs enforced all three
  unconditionally. `Spend` now mirrors ts-sdk (version <= 1 keeps the strict
  behavior), with explicit overrides via `set_require_minimal()`.
  27 previously-unsupported cross-SDK conformance vectors now execute and
  pass (census repinned in `tests/conformance_scripts.rs`).
- **Combined-script CHECKSIG subscript.** When a CHECKSIG executes in the
  unlocking script after an OP_CODESEPARATOR, the signed subscript continues
  across the unlock/lock boundary into the full locking script (legacy
  combined-script consensus semantics, matching ts-sdk and node behavior).
  bsv-rs previously truncated the subscript at the unlocking script, wrongly
  rejecting OP_PUSH_TX-style in-script signatures. The unlock→lock context
  switch now also resets `last_code_separator`, clears the alt stack, and
  requires terminated conditionals, as ts-sdk does.
- **High-S signature verification.** `ecdsa::verify` normalizes signatures to
  low-S before k256 `verify_prehash`, which rejects high-S by default. ECDSA
  (and consensus) accepts both `(r, s)` and `(r, n − s)`; low-S remains a
  script-layer *policy*, now correctly scoped to strict (version <= 1) mode.
- **Push-only opt-out.** `Spend::set_require_push_only(false)` allows
  executable code in unlocking scripts, which ts-sdk permits (the default
  remains enforced).

### Added

- `Transaction::invalidate_caches()` is now public: `inputs`/`outputs` are
  public fields, and mutating them directly (e.g. setting an output's
  satoshis or an input's `unlocking_script`) left `to_binary()`/`hash()`/
  `id()` returning stale cached serializations with no way to flush them.

## [0.3.14] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **Panic / OOM-abort on adversarial length prefixes (bounded pre-allocation).**
  Every parser that pre-allocated a collection sized by an attacker-controlled
  count read from the input (`Vec::with_capacity(count)`,
  `HashMap::with_capacity(count)`, `vec![default; count]`) could be made to
  abort the process with a capacity-overflow / OOM panic *before a single
  element was read*. A ~20-byte crafted BEEF whose transaction input-count
  varint is `0xFE FF FF FF FF` (u32::MAX) makes `Transaction::from_beef` /
  `Transaction::from_binary` allocate billions of `TransactionInput`s and
  abort — a trivially cheap denial-of-service (and on `wasm32`, where the build
  is `panic = abort`, it is unrecoverable: `.ok()` cannot catch it).

  All such sites now bound the pre-allocation to what the remaining buffer could
  actually contain via the new `primitives::bounded_capacity(count, remaining,
  min_elem_bytes)` helper — `count.min(remaining / min_elem_bytes)`. The read
  loop already errors the instant the buffer is exhausted, so parse results are
  unchanged for both valid and malicious input; only the (now bounded) capacity
  hint changes. A bogus count now yields `Err`, never a panic.

  Hardened sites: `transaction::Transaction::{from_reader, from_ef}`
  (input/output counts, and the EF `source_output_index` placeholder-output
  fabrication, which is now rejected above a 16 MiB allocation budget — the
  placeholder length is computed in `u64` via `ef_source_placeholder_len` so the
  `+ 1` cannot overflow on 32-bit targets: on `wasm32` `source_output_index as
  usize + 1` wrapped `u32::MAX` to `0`, defeating the budget check and then
  index-OOB-panicking on a zero-length vec),
  `primitives::bsv::sighash::parse_transaction`, `overlay` binary lookup
  responses, `wallet::wire` (string arrays/maps, action/output/certificate
  arrays, keyrings), and `auth` certificate/header parsing. Purely defensive;
  no API change beyond the additive `bounded_capacity` export → patch bump.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **wasm32 `Peer::to_peer` / BRC-103 handshake hang.** The `wasm` feature now
  enables `futures-timer/wasm-bindgen`. The wasm `wait_with_timeout` helper
  (the `Peer` handshake timeout) races the handshake future against a
  `futures_timer::Delay`, but the `wasm` feature previously pulled
  `futures-timer` *without* its `wasm-bindgen` feature. On
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` that selected `futures-timer`'s native timer-thread
  backend, so `Delay::new` panicked (`thread::spawn` is unsupported) on the
  first poll — hanging/aborting any `Peer::to_peer` call that initiates a
  handshake inside a Cloudflare Worker or browser `wasm-bindgen-futures`
  executor. Enabling `futures-timer/wasm-bindgen` flips it to the
  `gloo-timers`/`setTimeout` backend, which works in those environments.
  Pure additive feature wiring (no API change) → patch bump.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-04-21

### Added

- **`bsv_rs::overlay::create_signed_overlay_admin_token`** — produces
  TS-parity 5-field signed SHIP/SLAP advertisement tokens. Byte-exact
  match with `@bsv/sdk 1.10.1`'s
  `pushdrop.lock(fields, [2, protocol_name], '1', 'anyone', forSelf=true,
  includeSignature=true, lockPosition='before')` — the exact call
  `@bsv/overlay-discovery-services/src/WalletAdvertiser.ts` makes and
  what `nanostore.babbage.systems` / `overlay-us-1.bsvb.tech` validators
  admit under `tm_ship` / `tm_slap`.

  PushDrop layout:
  ```
  <locking_pubkey:33>  OP_CHECKSIG
  <"SHIP"|"SLAP">
  <identity_key:33>
  <domain>
  <topic_or_service>
  <signature_der>
  OP_2DROP OP_2DROP OP_DROP
  ```

  Locking pubkey + signing key are BRC-42 children of `root_key` for
  `protocolID = (SecurityLevel::Counterparty, "service host interconnect"
  | "service lookup availability")`, `keyID = "1"`, `counterparty =
  Anyone`, `forSelf = true`. Signature is ECDSA (RFC 6979 deterministic)
  over `sha256(concat(fields[0..4]))`.

  Takes `&PrivateKey` (not `&PublicKey`) because the function has to
  SIGN the advert.

- **`tests/vectors/overlay_admin_token_ts_parity.json`** — byte-exact
  parity vectors generated from `@bsv/sdk 1.10.1`. 5 cases covering SHIP
  (3 inputs, including long topic) + SLAP (2 inputs).

- **`tests/overlay_admin_token_ts_parity_tests.rs`** — blocking parity
  gate: loads the TS vectors and asserts
  `create_signed_overlay_admin_token(...)` reproduces them verbatim,
  plus a determinism guard for RFC-6979 signing.

### Deprecated

- **`bsv_rs::overlay::create_overlay_admin_token`** (soft deprecation,
  still compiles). It emits a 4-field unsigned PushDrop with the
  identity key as locking key — a shape `@bsv/overlay-discovery-services`
  requires but never admits, so any advert built with it is silently
  rejected by peer validators. See the `#[deprecated]` attribute for
  the migration pointer. The `decode_overlay_admin_token` reader still
  accepts both 4- and 5-field shapes for backward-compat.

### Notes — cross-SDK parity

- **Matches TS (`@bsv/sdk` 1.10.1)** byte-exact — the version deployed
  at `nanostore.babbage.systems` and `overlay-us-1.bsvb.tech`. Locking
  key + signing key both use `counterparty=Anyone, forSelf=true`, which
  is what `pushdrop.lock(...)` emits when `WalletAdvertiser.ts` calls
  it.

- **Diverges from Go SDK** (`github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/overlay/admin-token`).
  Go uses `counterparty=Self, forSelf=false`. By BRC-42 symmetry that
  yields the same locking pubkey, but `createSignature` with
  `counterparty=Self` derives a different signing key, so signatures
  differ and Go-produced tokens fail TS validators too. The Go SDK
  needs its own fix; `bsv-rs` matches the deployed reality.
