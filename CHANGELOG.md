## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.22] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed — BEEF linking is linear and verify walks by txid

- **`Beef::find_atomic_transaction` / `Transaction::from_beef` link each
  distinct unproven parent ONCE, and every later input sourcing the same txid
  gets a bare stub.** 0.3.21 linked every input in full by cloning the
  memoized parent, which is EXPONENTIAL IN MEMORY on a diamond chain: when
  each level spends both outputs of the previous unproven level (a wallet's
  ordinary change chain), every level then carries two full copies of the
  level below it, so 24 levels means 2^24 subtrees and `from_beef` dies on
  memory before verification even starts. The stub is the parent transaction
  itself (its outputs are what the input spends, and it carries the BUMP when
  the BEEF proves it), with every one of ITS inputs' `source_transaction` left
  `None`, so structure and work are linear in the BEEF. A 24-level diamond now
  links to 47 source objects (2 per level) instead of ~2^24, in 57 ms.
  Building a stub never copies a subtree, and the memo is filled before the
  descent, so a BEEF whose source links form a cycle terminates instead of
  recursing forever.
- **`Transaction::verify` walks BY TXID, not by object graph.** It first
  gathers every transaction reachable through `source_transaction` into a map
  keyed by txid (a copy carrying a merkle path wins outright, otherwise the
  copy with the most linked sources, and only the winner is descended), then
  processes each txid exactly once: a proven transaction is checked against
  the chain tracker and not descended; an unproven one is fee-checked when a
  fee model is given, and has every input's script executed with the source
  looked up BY TXID (the txid the input names, falling back to the id of
  whatever source object it holds, as TS does). Nothing is cloned in the walk,
  and no result depends on which copy of a parent an input happens to hold, so
  the linear structure above verifies exactly like a fully duplicated one.
  This is what 0.3.20 lacked: its walk reached a bare clone and refused a
  complete BEEF with `Input N has no source transaction`, which is what pushed
  0.3.21 into cloning everything. Error texts are unchanged (`Input N has no
  source transaction`, `Script validation failed for input N: ...`, `Fee is
  too low`, `Invalid merkle path for transaction ...`).
- **The reference's value rule is now enforced**: an unproven transaction whose
  outputs pay out more than its inputs bring in makes `verify` return
  `Ok(false)`, matching the TS SDK's `outputTotal > inputTotal` check, which
  the Rust walk had never carried. A transaction with no inputs at all is
  exempt (there is no ancestry to weigh it against; it is a synthetic root,
  never something the walk can judge).
- Regression tests: `a_deep_diamond_chain_links_and_verifies_in_linear_time`
  (24 levels: `from_beef` + `verify` in well under a second, and an upper
  bound on the number of linked source objects), the middle-level
  `a_corrupted_signature_in_the_middle_of_the_chain_is_refused`,
  `an_unproven_spend_creating_satoshis_is_refused`, and
  `two_inputs_from_one_unproven_parent_are_both_linked` (now asserting the
  linear structure: input 0 fully linked, input 1 a stub, both verifying).
  The exponential shape was found by the zanaadu overlay engine's own
  regression suite (2026-09-08).

## [0.3.21] - 2026-09-09 (YANKED: links every duplicate input by cloning, exponential on diamond chains; use 0.3.22)

### Fixed — BEEF ancestry linking for every input (ts-sdk parity)

- **`Beef::find_atomic_transaction` / `Transaction::from_beef` link EVERY input's
  `source_transaction` fully, however many inputs source the same
  transaction.** The previous walk kept a `visited` set keyed by txid and
  attached a bare clone to every input after the first, so two inputs sourcing
  the same unproven parent (a covenant output plus that transaction's own
  change, the ordinary shape of a wallet's second spend) left the second copy
  with no sources and no merkle path, and `Transaction::verify` failed it with
  `Input N has no source transaction` for a BEEF that carried everything. The
  TS SDK never sees this because its inputs share one `Transaction` object by
  reference; Rust owns a `Box` per input. The walk now memoizes the fully
  linked transaction per txid and reuses it for every later input: the linked
  structure equals the TS one and the work is linear in the BEEF, never
  exponential along a chain whose spends source two outputs of their parent.
  Regression test `two_inputs_from_one_unproven_parent_are_both_linked`; found
  live on zanaadu beta (2026-09-08) the first day its overlay executed scripts
  on submit.

### Added — midstate-reuse sighash API (`SighashCache`)

- **`primitives::bsv::sighash::SighashCache`** — a cache over one
  transaction's BIP-143 midstates (`hashPrevouts`, `hashSequence`,
  `hashOutputs`), following rust-bitcoin's `SighashCache` pattern. Each
  midstate is computed lazily at most once per scope class and reused across
  inputs; the free functions recompute all three per call, making per-input
  signing of an n-input transaction O(n²) in hashing (a measured ~9× penalty
  at n=50). One cache instance safely serves mixed sighash scopes
  (ALL/NONE/SINGLE × ANYONECANPAY × FORKID). API:
  `SighashCache::new(&RawTransaction)` / `from_parts(...)`,
  `hash_prevouts(scope)`, `hash_sequence(scope)`,
  `hash_outputs(input_index, scope)`,
  `preimage(input_index, subscript, satoshis, scope)`,
  `sighash(...)` (display order), `sighash_for_signing(...)` (signing order).
- `build_sighash_preimage` (and therefore `compute_sighash` /
  `compute_sighash_for_signing`) is now a thin wrapper over a fresh
  single-use `SighashCache` — one preimage implementation in the crate,
  public API and behavior unchanged. Byte-equality is pinned by scope-class
  unit tests, by the 499-vector cross-SDK sighash suite run through the cache
  across every input, and by the 5,116-vector ts-stack conformance census
  (`tests/conformance_scripts.rs`), whose sighash path now exercises the
  cache directly.

### Documented

- RFC 6979 digest-domain note on `PrivateKey::sign` and in the `sighash`
  module docs: for a digest >= n (P ≈ 2⁻¹²⁸ for sha256d output), k256 seeds
  the nonce DRBG with `bits2octets(digest)` per the RFC while libsecp256k1
  and `@bsv/sdk` seed it with the raw digest bytes — deterministic signature
  bytes differ across stacks in that regime only; in-range digests are signed
  byte-identically. Pinned by `rfc6979_in_range_digest_der_is_pinned` and
  `rfc6979_digest_ge_n_der_is_pinned` in `tests/ec_tests.rs`.

## [0.3.19] — 2026-08-25

### Fixed — BEEF merkle-path reattachment (ts-sdk parity)

- **`Transaction::from_beef` and `Beef::find_atomic_transaction` dropped the
  merkle path.** Both cloned the parsed transaction out of the BEEF, so the
  returned transaction carried `merkle_path: None` even when the BEEF proved
  it — every caller asking "is this mined?" got "no" forever. Bumps live in
  `Beef::bumps` and are referenced by `BeefTx::bump_index` rather than being
  stored inside the transaction, so they must be reattached explicitly.
  This diverged from the TypeScript reference: `@bsv/sdk`'s
  `Transaction.fromBEEF` resolves the target txid and calls
  `Beef.findAtomicTransaction`, which runs `addInputProof` to set
  `current.merklePath` and link input sources.
- **`Beef::add_input_proof`** (private) ports that traversal: walk the
  transaction graph, attach the BUMP where one exists and stop descending that
  branch (a proven transaction needs no ancestry), otherwise link each input's
  `source_transaction` from the BEEF and continue into it. `from_beef` now
  routes through `find_atomic_transaction` the way `fromBEEF` routes through
  `findAtomicTransaction`, so both entry points behave identically.
- Regression tests are proven non-vacuous (reverting the fix fails them), and
  the fixture builds its BEEF through this crate's own writer so it cannot
  drift from the wire format.

## [0.3.16] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed — Spend engine ts-sdk parity

Four `Spend` divergences from the TypeScript `@bsv/sdk` engine, surfaced by
executing large OP_PUSH_TX-style covenant scripts that are valid under ts-sdk
and accepted by mainnet nodes but failed bsv-rs local validation:

- **Version-based relaxed mode.** ts-sdk runs transactions with version > 1
  under post-Genesis "relaxed" semantics (`Spend.isRelaxed()`): MINIMALDATA,
  LOW_S and CLEANSTACK are not enforced. bsv-rs enforced all three
  unconditionally. `Spend` now mirrors ts-sdk (version <= 1 keeps the strict
  behavior), with explicit overrides via `set_require_minimal()`.
  27 previously-unsupported cross-SDK conformance vectors now execute and
  pass (census repinned in `tests/conformance_scripts.rs`).
- **Combined-script CHECKSIG subscript.** When a CHECKSIG executes in the
  unlocking script after an OP_CODESEPARATOR, the signed subscript continues
  across the unlock/lock boundary into the full locking script (legacy
  combined-script consensus semantics, matching ts-sdk and node behavior).
  bsv-rs previously truncated the subscript at the unlocking script, wrongly
  rejecting OP_PUSH_TX-style in-script signatures. The unlock→lock context
  switch now also resets `last_code_separator`, clears the alt stack, and
  requires terminated conditionals, as ts-sdk does.
- **High-S signature verification.** `ecdsa::verify` normalizes signatures to
  low-S before k256 `verify_prehash`, which rejects high-S by default. ECDSA
  (and consensus) accepts both `(r, s)` and `(r, n − s)`; low-S remains a
  script-layer *policy*, now correctly scoped to strict (version <= 1) mode.
- **Push-only opt-out.** `Spend::set_require_push_only(false)` allows
  executable code in unlocking scripts, which ts-sdk permits (the default
  remains enforced).

### Added

- `Transaction::invalidate_caches()` is now public: `inputs`/`outputs` are
  public fields, and mutating them directly (e.g. setting an output's
  satoshis or an input's `unlocking_script`) left `to_binary()`/`hash()`/
  `id()` returning stale cached serializations with no way to flush them.

## [0.3.14] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **Panic / OOM-abort on adversarial length prefixes (bounded pre-allocation).**
  Every parser that pre-allocated a collection sized by an attacker-controlled
  count read from the input (`Vec::with_capacity(count)`,
  `HashMap::with_capacity(count)`, `vec![default; count]`) could be made to
  abort the process with a capacity-overflow / OOM panic *before a single
  element was read*. A ~20-byte crafted BEEF whose transaction input-count
  varint is `0xFE FF FF FF FF` (u32::MAX) makes `Transaction::from_beef` /
  `Transaction::from_binary` allocate billions of `TransactionInput`s and
  abort — a trivially cheap denial-of-service (and on `wasm32`, where the build
  is `panic = abort`, it is unrecoverable: `.ok()` cannot catch it).

  All such sites now bound the pre-allocation to what the remaining buffer could
  actually contain via the new `primitives::bounded_capacity(count, remaining,
  min_elem_bytes)` helper — `count.min(remaining / min_elem_bytes)`. The read
  loop already errors the instant the buffer is exhausted, so parse results are
  unchanged for both valid and malicious input; only the (now bounded) capacity
  hint changes. A bogus count now yields `Err`, never a panic.

  Hardened sites: `transaction::Transaction::{from_reader, from_ef}`
  (input/output counts, and the EF `source_output_index` placeholder-output
  fabrication, which is now rejected above a 16 MiB allocation budget — the
  placeholder length is computed in `u64` via `ef_source_placeholder_len` so the
  `+ 1` cannot overflow on 32-bit targets: on `wasm32` `source_output_index as
  usize + 1` wrapped `u32::MAX` to `0`, defeating the budget check and then
  index-OOB-panicking on a zero-length vec),
  `primitives::bsv::sighash::parse_transaction`, `overlay` binary lookup
  responses, `wallet::wire` (string arrays/maps, action/output/certificate
  arrays, keyrings), and `auth` certificate/header parsing. Purely defensive;
  no API change beyond the additive `bounded_capacity` export → patch bump.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **wasm32 `Peer::to_peer` / BRC-103 handshake hang.** The `wasm` feature now
  enables `futures-timer/wasm-bindgen`. The wasm `wait_with_timeout` helper
  (the `Peer` handshake timeout) races the handshake future against a
  `futures_timer::Delay`, but the `wasm` feature previously pulled
  `futures-timer` *without* its `wasm-bindgen` feature. On
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` that selected `futures-timer`'s native timer-thread
  backend, so `Delay::new` panicked (`thread::spawn` is unsupported) on the
  first poll — hanging/aborting any `Peer::to_peer` call that initiates a
  handshake inside a Cloudflare Worker or browser `wasm-bindgen-futures`
  executor. Enabling `futures-timer/wasm-bindgen` flips it to the
  `gloo-timers`/`setTimeout` backend, which works in those environments.
  Pure additive feature wiring (no API change) → patch bump.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-04-21

### Added

- **`bsv_rs::overlay::create_signed_overlay_admin_token`** — produces
  TS-parity 5-field signed SHIP/SLAP advertisement tokens. Byte-exact
  match with `@bsv/sdk 1.10.1`'s
  `pushdrop.lock(fields, [2, protocol_name], '1', 'anyone', forSelf=true,
  includeSignature=true, lockPosition='before')` — the exact call
  `@bsv/overlay-discovery-services/src/WalletAdvertiser.ts` makes and
  what `nanostore.babbage.systems` / `overlay-us-1.bsvb.tech` validators
  admit under `tm_ship` / `tm_slap`.

  PushDrop layout:
  ```
  <locking_pubkey:33>  OP_CHECKSIG
  <"SHIP"|"SLAP">
  <identity_key:33>
  <domain>
  <topic_or_service>
  <signature_der>
  OP_2DROP OP_2DROP OP_DROP
  ```

  Locking pubkey + signing key are BRC-42 children of `root_key` for
  `protocolID = (SecurityLevel::Counterparty, "service host interconnect"
  | "service lookup availability")`, `keyID = "1"`, `counterparty =
  Anyone`, `forSelf = true`. Signature is ECDSA (RFC 6979 deterministic)
  over `sha256(concat(fields[0..4]))`.

  Takes `&PrivateKey` (not `&PublicKey`) because the function has to
  SIGN the advert.

- **`tests/vectors/overlay_admin_token_ts_parity.json`** — byte-exact
  parity vectors generated from `@bsv/sdk 1.10.1`. 5 cases covering SHIP
  (3 inputs, including long topic) + SLAP (2 inputs).

- **`tests/overlay_admin_token_ts_parity_tests.rs`** — blocking parity
  gate: loads the TS vectors and asserts
  `create_signed_overlay_admin_token(...)` reproduces them verbatim,
  plus a determinism guard for RFC-6979 signing.

### Deprecated

- **`bsv_rs::overlay::create_overlay_admin_token`** (soft deprecation,
  still compiles). It emits a 4-field unsigned PushDrop with the
  identity key as locking key — a shape `@bsv/overlay-discovery-services`
  requires but never admits, so any advert built with it is silently
  rejected by peer validators. See the `#[deprecated]` attribute for
  the migration pointer. The `decode_overlay_admin_token` reader still
  accepts both 4- and 5-field shapes for backward-compat.

### Notes — cross-SDK parity

- **Matches TS (`@bsv/sdk` 1.10.1)** byte-exact — the version deployed
  at `nanostore.babbage.systems` and `overlay-us-1.bsvb.tech`. Locking
  key + signing key both use `counterparty=Anyone, forSelf=true`, which
  is what `pushdrop.lock(...)` emits when `WalletAdvertiser.ts` calls
  it.

- **Diverges from Go SDK** (`github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/overlay/admin-token`).
  Go uses `counterparty=Self, forSelf=false`. By BRC-42 symmetry that
  yields the same locking pubkey, but `createSignature` with
  `counterparty=Self` derives a different signing key, so signatures
  differ and Go-produced tokens fail TS validators too. The Go SDK
  needs its own fix; `bsv-rs` matches the deployed reality.
